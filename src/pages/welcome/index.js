                    <h3>Favorly (FAVORs for the elderLY) intends to solve this ubiquitous issue by creating a welcoming community for the elders and for kind helpers; the platform aims to connect society with elders living alone who need certain favors completed, or simply want somebody to help them.  </h3>

                    <h3> The elders are able to request a favor with a deadline, title, description, and image, while helpers can view all open requests and give favors. In doing so, the requester of the favor will receive an email detailing the favor's completion. There might also be incentives provided for the helpers to engage them to help the elders out.</h3>

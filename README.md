## Inspiration
Despite the fact that our team is from various countries, we all came together with the same problem: **elderly hate crimes**. In a society where the main focus lies on the younger generation, we often overlook the problems impacting the older generation. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has begun, anti-Elderly hate crimes in the USA has risen by a shocking 850%. As we approach March, a notice in anti-Asian elderly hate crimes has spurred, specifically in the Bay Area and across America. **11+ people older than 70 were assaulted and 3 of them killed just in the San Francisco Bay Area.**

As software developers, we created **Favorly**, a platform for supporting our elders efficiently through connecting **“favorable helpers."**

## What it does
Favorly aims to solve all problems that occur within elderly people’s daily lives. The users, including both the elders and supporters, are allowed to either request a favor or give a favor. The elders are able to request a favor with a deadline, title, description, and image. In doing so, other users who are possible to give a favor are allowed to message the requester directly through a message function or accepting the request. 

Once the helper clicks that they have finished the task, the elder receives an email that the task has been finished. Due to Firebase, **tasks sync in real-time with all users from around the world.**

## How we built it
Prior to every step of our creation, we started brainstorming on how we can encourage the users through a business perspective. Also, we had to research the current market to determine whether the functions of Favorly can effectively help the elderly people. We used Visual Studio Code extensions to collaborate virtually via a React.js-Firebase web app. Firebase and its corresponding database in Firestore contains authentication features to facilitate the process of signing up and posting favors.


## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenges that our team ran into was the difference in time zones and collaborating through a virtual environment. Since we had to overcome the time zone difference, which was about 15~17 hours max among team members, we had to frequently stay up until midnight in order to communicate with each other constantly and smoothly. 

Jumping around from Twilio and various SMS and emailing APIs, we decided on Email.js. Our two back-end developers had issues understanding and incorporating Email.js. Almost three hours later, our team pushed through, and **notifications can be sent to the desired user**. Also, even though we had a limited amount of collaboration time--12 hours--, we were able to implement our maximum potential to Favorably. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Beyond the focus on such hackathons, we are impressed by the fact that we successfully completed a project that can** change our entire world.** We were able to acknowledge societal problems regarding the disregard for the elderly occurring around countries through researching deeply about this project. We are proud of each other that we were able to overcome the virtual environment and build up a meaningful project.

## What's next for Favorly
Besides offering an opportunity to help elderly people through Favorly, we hope that it will encourage real younger generation users around the world in the future. Favorly’s features have a high potential of solving the problems within elders' lives, which can eventually expand to related areas involving other minorities. We are highly eager to **improve the features of Favorly in order to maximize its potential as a helper and beta test soon!**


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
